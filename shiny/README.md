# OPUF SURVEY APPLICATION

Folder structure:
    
    app.R       # shiny app 
    custom.css  # custom style rules for the OPUF app
    modules/    # R script to generate the UI and server R code for each task
    output/     # folder in which survey responses are stored
    R/          # functions to create the 'placeholder' descriptive system
    www/        # additional js source files and logos 
  

N.B.: Unfortunately, we are not allowed to use the labels of the EQ-5D-5L instrument. 
The code contains placeholders ('dimension A', 'dimension B', etc.) instead.
